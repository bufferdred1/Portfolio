today i managed to add some more html to my file named html portfolio.Tuesday 15/04.2025
I am writing this read me file. this is about the project portfolio. I have made the website stating my qualifications and mentioning my skills and my attributes. I have much to learn and I will be asking for patience. I am a beginner to the world of coding, I want to broad my aspects in this field and showing off my skills by making this portfolio and other future projects. It is a task that proves my status as a front end developer. I am progressing and making a name for myself, the languages I am practising are, Html, CSS and Java Script. These are the main frontline languages in practice. Things are going well and my confidence is challenged and measured. I started this project as the first project whilst partaking this course and I feel like it steered me towards the right direction in my coding career.
